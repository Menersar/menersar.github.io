## Setup for MQTT Connection (for the Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS))

### Required (for connection with local MQTT-Broker): 
- Install Mosquitto MQTT broker on a local PC (found under \Sources\_Mosquitto MQTT Broker).
- Replace the "mosquitto.conf" in the mosquitto installation folder with the "mosquitto.conf" file (found under \Sources\_MosquittoMQTTBroker).
- Run the Command Prompt as administrator and type "net start mosquitto" to start the mosquitto MQTT broker locally ("net stop mosquitto" to stop).

### Nice to have for monitoring of the MQTT messages:
- Install MQTT.fx (found under \Sources\_MQTTFx).
- Click on the options icon, if installed on the same computer as the MQTT broker, set the Broker Adress to "127.0.0.1" and the Port to "1883".
- Click on Connect.
- Now you are able to Subscribe and Publish to Topics.
- For this project the two topics used are "M2MQTT_Unity/test/ESPXY/outTopic" (messages from the ESP) and "M2MQTT_Unity/test/ESPXY/inTopic" (messages from Unity / the application).
